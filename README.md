# Phd Math Project

A software to analyze a octal number and generate formula to produce graph. (Phd Project in mathematics field, Article)

I'm supervisor of this software to help in this research. (It will publish as article)

## Process

- get octal number
- convert number to binary (base 2)
- compare binary data to generate new matrix
- compare binary data to generate formula
- check formula to detect their edge is dotted or solid.
